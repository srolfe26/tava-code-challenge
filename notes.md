2025-03-24:
 - Added git to help me track changes for myself along with gitignore
 - Separated into frontend and backend folders
 - Frontend npm build has several things out of date, look into this
 - Will build backend in node/express
 - Will add docker compose file to make it all run
 - AI Prompt: In the @backend folder, create a typescript on Node project. Setup a basic Nest.js server with a basic health check endpoint for now
    - GET http://localhost:3000/health
